# Situation Tracker

I am aware there are likely existing solutions for this issue, this is just for practice and for the love of creating a custom tool.

## Problem and Solution

### Problem:
Manually monitoring multiple feeds, such as social media accounts or news outlets, to stay updated on a specific topic is time-consuming and prone to missing critical updates.

### Solution:
Automate the monitoring process using an LLM-driven workflow that aggregates updates from specified sources and delivers a tailored report, allowing users to stay informed at their preferred level of detail.

## Current Concept Overview

### Input:
- A specific topic of interest (e.g., a particular startup, geopolitical developments in a region).
- Preferred sources:
  - Traditional news outlets.
  - Social media profiles.
  - Other relevant data sources.

### Process:
The goal is to streamline the process of manually monitoring feeds or catching relevant updates at the right moment. Instead, the system automates this task and delivers a clear, tailored report that allows you to stay high-level or dive into details as needed. Provide a topic and a list of accounts (either manually or through a chatbot interface that identifies the exact accounts/sources for you and handles the setup).

### Output:
- A report summarizing meaningful updates from an arbitrary number of specified sources.
- Designed for continuous, automated updates from selected feeds, providing concise and relevant information.
- Not a research tool but a focused solution for targeted updates, distinct from mainstream foundation models.
